				<title>Table tennis robot</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Roughly one year ago, I saw a video on youtube showing off a robot playing table
tennis against a human (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imVNg9j7rvU&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I was impressed until I found out
a few hours later that it was just a fake video used for a PR campaign. However, these
days I was watching the video again and wondered if it wouldn&amp;#39;t be a cool idea
to make a real table tennis robot capable of playing like that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Doorman</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer semester 2014, me and 3 other students were looking for a new place to live.
We eventually found a nice and modern flat, which was sublet to us by a PhD student.
Unfortunately, the landlord of the place was not happy about four students moving in and
refused to give us two additional keys, which meant that we had only 2 keys for 4 students :(
Making copies of our keys was not an option, since you need an special agreement from the
landlord to be able to make copies.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Hello World!</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;These are the first words of my new blog, hosted on github. The main purpose of this blog is to show off some of my projects
and to write things down that I have on my mind. I&amp;#39;m a bit afraid that this blog will become abandoned soon (as so many
diaries have before), but I&amp;#39;ll do my best to prevent this.&lt;/p&gt;
