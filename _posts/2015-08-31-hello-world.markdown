These are the first words of my new blog, hosted on github. The main purpose of this blog is to show off some of my projects
and to write things down that I have on my mind. I'm a bit afraid that this blog will become abandoned soon (as so many
diaries have before), but I'll do my best to prevent this.

To the technogolical facts of this blog: It's based on [Jekyll][jekyll] which transforms plain text into static
websites and blogs, rather than storing most of the content in a database. Another good thing about it is, that it can be
hosted on github pages, as it is the case here.

I created a template based on the [Google Material Design Lite][mdl], to make the blog a bit more stylish.
The source code and demo can be found on my github [repository][jekyll-mdl-repo].

Edit: I switched to a new jekyll theme based on the [Mickey][mickey] template from Vincent Chan.
