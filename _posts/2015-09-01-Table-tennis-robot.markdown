Roughly one year ago, I saw a video on youtube showing off a robot playing table
tennis against a human (see [here][youtube]). I was impressed until I found out
a few hours later that it was just a fake video used for a PR campaign. However, these
days I was watching the video again and wondered if it wouldn't be a cool idea
to make a real table tennis robot capable of playing like that.

For now I haven't done much for it, but my basic schedule for the project is as
follows:

- Figure out required DoF
- Create CAD drawings of the robot
- Generate URDF so robot can be used with MoveIt!
- Simulation in Gazebo (ball + table, pose estimation, robot movement)
- ...
- Manufacture real robot (3d printing, motors etc.)

It will be an exciting project and I can't wait to work with MoveIt! again.
